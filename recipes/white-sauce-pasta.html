            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <hr>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil raw pasta according to the instructions given on the package or follow following
                    instructions; Take 4-5 cups water in deep sauce pan, bring it to boil over medium flame. When it
                    start boiling, add 3/4 cup Penne pasta and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Boil them until al-dente (cooked but not very soft). It will take around 10-12 minutes. To check
                    whether pasta is cooked or not, take one pasta in a fork and bite it. If it is little firm to
                    bite, it is cooked. If it is too hard to bite, it requires more cooking.</li>
                <li>Transfer cooked pasta to a large colander and drain excess water.</li>
                <li>While pasta is cooking, heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in a pan or kadai over high flame. Add 1/4 cup
                    chopped carrot, 1/4 cup chopped green capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped red capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped
                    broccoli and salt.</li>
                <li>Stir and cook until veggies are little cooked but still crunchy, for around 2-3 minutes. Turn
                    off the flame and transfer them to a plate.</li>
                <li>Heat 1½ tablespoons butter in the same pan or kadai over medium flame. Add 1/2 teaspoon finely
                    chopped garlic and sauté for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add 1½ tablespoons maida (all purpose flour).</li>
                <li>Stir continuously and cook for a minute.</li>
                <li>Pour 1½ cups milk little by little while stirring continuously with a whisk.</li>
                <li>Stir and mix for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce flame to low. Continue stirring and cooking until mixture starts to thicken. It will take
                    around 3-4 minutes depending on the size and thickness of the pan. When mixture starts to coat
                    the back of a spoon as shown in the picture here, it means that it has started to thicken.</li>
                <li>Add 1/4 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoon red chilli flakes, a pinch of black pepper powder and
                    salt.</li>
                <li>Mix well.</li>
                <li>Add sautéed vegetables and pasta.</li>
                <li>Turn off the flame. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Transfer it to a serving plate. White sauce pasta is now ready. Garnish it with grated cheese
                    and serve while they are still hot.</li>
