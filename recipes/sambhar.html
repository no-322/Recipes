        <h2>Desciption</h2>
        <hr class="hra">
        <p> Sambar is a South Indian lentil and vegetable stew that is eaten along with rice, idli or dosa. A basic
            sambar recipe will have a mix or one or two types of vegetables along with lentils, tamarind, sambar powder
            and a few spices. The key to a tasty sambar is having a good quality sambar powder. </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Before we begin making sambar, it always helps to soak tamarind in water earlier. So soak 1 tablespoon
                tamarind in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained
                tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked pasta to a large colander and drain excess water.</li>
            <li>Rinse ½ cup tuvar dal (100 grams) a couple of times in fresh and clean water. You can use a strainer to
                rinse the lentils. For quick cooking of the lentils you can opt to soak them for an hour prior to
                cooking.</li>
            <li> Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.
            </li>
            <li>Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups of water and mix.</li>
            <li>Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely
                cooked and mushy. mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk. Cover and keep aside. You can see the
                consistency of dal in the picture below.</li>
            <li>When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables. When making sambar, chop the
                vegetables which get cooked faster in large sizes like pumpkin, brinjals (small aubergines) okra,
                drumsticks etc. .</li>
            <li>Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium
                onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste. Adding
                kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. I add it for a nice bright color in the
                sambar.</li>
            <li> Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir. Add enough water so that they cover the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium flame. in between do
                check when the vegetables are cooking.</li>
            <li>Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t overcook the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Add the prepared tamarind pulp to the cooked vegetables. If you don’t have dried tamarind then use
                packaged or bottled tamarind paste. You can add about ½ to 1 tablespoon of the tamarind paste or add as
                according to your taste. </li>
            <li>Mix well.</li>
            <li>Next add 1 to 1.5 tablespoons Sambar Powder. At this step you can also add ½ to 1 teaspoon of jaggery
                powder. Adding jaggery is optional.</li>
            <li>Stir and mix well again.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed dal.</li>
            <li>Mix very well. If the consistency looks very thick, you can add some water. You can easily adjust the
                quantity of water and make medium to thin consistency of sambar. But keep in mind not to add too much of
                water as this will dilute the flavors. </li>

            <li>Simmer on a medium-low flame till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals. You will see a frothy layer on
                top when the sambar begins boiling. </li>
            <li>In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil (oil made from raw sesame seeds). </li>
            <li>Let the mustard seeds crackle.</li>
            <li>Then add 1 to 2 dry red chillies (halved and seeds removed).</li>
            <li> Immediately add 10 to 12 curry leaves, 5 to 6 fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) and 2 pinches of asafoetida
                (hing). Be careful while adding curry leaves as the oil splutters a lot. </li>
            <li>Fry them till the red chilies change color and curry leaves become crisp.</li>
            <li>Immediately add this tempering mixture in the hot sambar.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from the tempering mixture
                get infused with the sambar.</li>
            <li>Serve sambar hot or warm. Garnish with some coriander leaves if you prefer. Usually, it is is cooked a
                two-three hours earlier as its taste becomes better with time.</li>
        </ol>
